## macOS Task Manger
A WIP alternative to Activity Monitor using SwiftUI.

This app provides the ability to hide System apps, so the apps that are shown accurately represents the third-party software running on the machine. It determines this by filtering out programs that are included in [System Integrity Protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection).

### Future
- More metrics
- Prettier interface
